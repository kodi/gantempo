# Gantempo

React and TypeScript primitives for Gantt charts, resource planning, and scheduling.

## Toolchain

- [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/) for formatting, linting, type checking, and tests
- [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/) through `vp pack` for library bundles
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for the Node.js runtime
- pnpm pinned through the workspace `packageManager` field
- React 19 for development, with React 18 and 19 supported as peer versions
- TypeScript 7

## Setup

Install the Vite+ `vp` CLI once, then bootstrap the pinned environment and dependencies:

```sh
mise install
vp install
```

Run the development checks:

```sh
vp check
vp test run
vp pack
```

The same commands are available as mise tasks:

```sh
mise run ci
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the planned package boundaries.
